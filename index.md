## Coffe and Code

This project aims to evaluate the headlines of the New York newspaper between January and July 2020 and see how the words like COVID and Virus have taken on relevance over these months.


### Words Most Mentioned in New York Times in 2020

According to WHO, coronavirus was first reported in Wuhan (China) on December 31, 2020.

On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID a pandemic. The COVID-19 related timeline can be checked [here](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/29-06-2020-covidtimeline).

It's possible to imagine the words _Coronavirus_, _virus_ and _pandemic_ have been most cited since January until July 2020. But how many others were relevant in the same period?  How do we can analyze them?

To respond to these questions, I have chosen one source and two tools:

- Source: New York Times newspaper to select the headlines of the articles from January to July.
- Tools: The Natural Language Toolkit (**NLTK**), a **Python** library for handling natural language processing (**NLP**), and **Tableau**, a visual analytics platform.
